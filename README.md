><h3>This page is the solution to our current disconnect between us and our user base, which is unbelievably important to us.</h3>
><h3>This introduction gives samll examples of the things we hope to accomplpish in the time ahead.</h3>

><h3>We've learned a lot through the building process and will continue to imrpove and expand off of what we've currently built and can't wait to see where it is in just a few months</h3>

><h3>We used VS code, to build our page and github to launch the HTML into a live link, we faced some challenges on the way but it didn't stop our progression, we hope to have much more implemented in the future such as live support chat, a video introdction from our team and many more things.</h3>
